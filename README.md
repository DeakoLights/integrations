# Integrations Repo

This repository is intended to eventually become the home for hass.io integrations as well as any other documents.

# API

The [telnet API](./API.md) is subject to change without notice and is still considered a work in progress. 

# Devices

At this time, only some deako devices have the telnet server running.

# Fake Device

The included node project in the fake_device folder is included as a tool to help create a fake device to use for testing interactions with the Deako Device
